#CarND Path Planning process

After doing excercises with breath first and depth first search, while working with naive bayes implementation feel quiet lost
with trajectory generation.

## Initial Strategy

while working on the excercies, I feel like I have not grasped the concepts. I have decided to play with the data and have simple static data and speed
to see how my car move and understand my environment.
